## Part 1 - Before Budibase was Budibase, before Joe

The project with no name, never had a name, and will remain nameless.

I had a few problems that I felt need solving

### The drive to do something

Early 2018, I had worked as a software developer for ~10 years, and had recently been having the feeling like I was cruising in my career. Just letting it happen.

I cycled to work each day, watching crowds of people going in the same direction. In my mind they were all cruising mindlessly, just like me.

I have been very lucky in my life. Great family all my life, and great opportunities. I felt like I was wasting the opportunities given to me by not making more of myself.

So, I started to re-evaluate. Where did I want to be in 10 years? I felt like I had 3 options

- Climb the corporate ladder. My least favourite option. I knew that I couldn't stomach that environment.
- Freelancing. I could do this. But there was something about it that felt limited. Would I have to be a developer forever? Jumping from one job to the next? I didn't like that inconsistency, and sometimes struggled with 9-5 coding anyway - probably not a good fit.
- Start my own business. This one I had always wanted, but had always been avoiding. What do I know about running a business? I lacked confidence, but felt excited at the thought. This was the only option.

#### Discovering confidence

Previously, I had very little confidence in my ability to start a business. But in the past few years, I had been listening to a lot of podcasts, which had made me realise that almost everyone feel this way.

I had seen friends do it, so I had already begun to normalise it. 

This all led to me both gaining confidence in myself, and simultaneously realising that not having the confidence is normal - healthy in fact. 

#### My way

All the companies that I'd worked for were great. I learned a lot, and worked with great people. I got exposure to broad parts of the business right from the start of my career.

However, I always felt ...

1. That I could do better in some areas, but didn't have the control to implement the change

2. In the back of my head,  there were bound to be reasons why we were doing it the way we were, and I was just inexperienced

As I read and listened to the world of business, and products, I realised that my ideas were shared by others, and used successfully. Again, this reassured me that I was on the right track

### Product Idea

Earlier, I had already begun developing a piece of software in my spare time, just for fun. I had trouble finding software to help me organise my like. I had been using Evernote 

#### Evernote reduced it's free tier

Evernote premium was good value, but I just didn't have enough notes stored to justify paying for it.

#### Evernote didn't quite fit

Evernote is a note taking application, and at the time was built mainly for rich text notes. 

I wanted to store more structured data - XML & JSON config files, Contacts, Kanban boards.

I wanted to ability to extend the software to fit my needs

#### Evernote lock in

Whether this is a valid concern or not, this is how I felt. Evernote had my notes, and they could disappear at anytime (but probably not!).

#### My solution

Features would include

- An open source license
- A desktop application
- Ability to define structured data - i.e. database records, with defined fields
- Ability to plugin custom UI controls
- Good integration points, for data in and data out
- Data would be stored in readable files, locally, or on cloud file storage

### Pivot 

At some point, I realised that what I was actually building was a low-code builder or personal organization. 



At this time, I had never heard the phrase "low-code" or "no-code". 

I had no idea that anything like this existed.
